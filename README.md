# Studio X multiplayer project
This project shows an example of simple multiplayer game mechanics. The project uses [NoobHub](https://github.com/Overtorment/NoobHub) to broadcast data between clients. The project doesn't use an authoritative server, the clients are naively trusted completely.

## HTML5
This project doesn't support HTML5. NoobHub expects a normal TCP socket connection while HTML5 builds upgrade sockets to websockets.

## Suggested exercises
* Add score counter
* Add more enemy types
* Add sound effects
* Replace with other graphics - perhaps a top down shooter?
